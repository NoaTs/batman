  <p>This is my imaginary paragraph about random blurb, since I've skipped a few lessons and didn't do as I was told.</p>
  <p>Though it wasn't really my fault but rather OTP's one as they told me to only read 4 chapters. Anyways, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like" target="_blank">"What should your website look like?"</a> is a really good starter!</p>
    <!--hehe above I just learnt how to link the Url by using <a href="url"</a->
  and now I've just learned how to open it in a new window by using the target="_blank"> option-->
    <br>
    <p>This is going to be an example of an unsorted list</p>
      <code>Bla di blub</code> <!--Check out what this does-->
      <ul>
        <li>numero eins</li>
        <li>list always</li>
        <li>need < li> tags</li>
      </ul>
     <p>and here comes the sorted list</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Here we use</li>
        <li> ol not ul</li>
        <li>and still li tags</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I can't quite figure out why this and the second paragraph is indented. Anyone?</p>
      <p><strong>Now </strong> I can! It has something to do with the < code>< ul>< /code> to do. Need to consult Google!
      Also on how to insert code visible on website without cheating aka spaces ;)</p>
      <p>Below was like the first attempt of using JavaScript on top of my freshly acquired HTML and CSS skills. Anyways, since I didn't really fully read the instructions and just rushed through the tutorial - need to check out this again:
