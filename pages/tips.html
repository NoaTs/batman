<!--Above is an explanation probably copied from Shay Howe-->

<p>So let's create another page and call it "Errors" to check once I find a brainy as to why I keep breaking my code.
  Also I should <strong>PAY ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!!</strong> when coding as it happens quite often that there's a typo or I missed a bracket or alike. Maybe worth into looking "Code Validator" haven't really explored this much along with "Developer Tools".
</p>
<p>Once I got myself more organised and structured while learning to code, dive deep into "Git & GitHub", the latter being for version control but also what employers are really after as it acts as my portfolio.
  Also check out "tooltips" or whatsever it's called. If I got it right then it displays a text when one hovers over the word. This could be used to explain the diff between lose and loose for example.
</p>
<p>So since it took me a long time to finally get the path correct - meaning it took me a long time to link correctly after creating pages folder but with index.html outside. Also linking CSS sheets again properly. Anyways, <a href="http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/"target="blank">this one is helpful</a></p>

<p>Ok as it seems there are oddles of 'things' out there that a dev needs but I'm a bit overwhelmed by all the things out there so let's write them down, shall we?
  <ul>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>CodePen</li>
    <li>Chrome Developer Tools</li>
    <li>code validator</li>
    <li>soooooo many more</li>
  </ul>
